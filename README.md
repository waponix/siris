# Project Overview: Siris - PHP Templating Engine with Component Composition

## Introduction
Siris is an open-source project dedicated to creating a templating engine in PHP that embraces the component-based paradigm inspired by well-known reactive frameworks. The primary focus of this project is on facilitating seamless component composition, allowing developers to build modular, reusable, and maintainable user interfaces in PHP applications.

## Project Goals
1. **Component Modularity**: Siris aims to enable developers to break down user interfaces into smaller, manageable components, promoting code reusability and ease of maintenance.

2. **Encapsulation and Reusability**: The project prioritizes encapsulation, ensuring that each component is self-contained and can be reused across the application or even in different projects.

3. **Flexible Composition**: Siris provides a flexible system for composing components, allowing developers to nest components within one another to create complex UI structures easily.

4. **Intuitive API for Components**: The project strives to create an intuitive and developer-friendly API for defining and interacting with components, simplifying the development process.

## Key Features
- **Component Definition**: Siris offers a clear and structured way to define components, including their logic, templates, and styles, enhancing organization and maintainability.

- **Component Nesting**: Developers can nest components within one another, facilitating the creation of intricate UI structures while maintaining component encapsulation.

- **Component Lifecycle Hooks**: Siris allows developers to define lifecycle hooks for components, enabling actions to be executed at specific stages of a component's lifecycle (e.g., creation, update, destruction).

- **Component Communication**: The project supports communication between components, enabling parent-child and sibling components to exchange data and trigger actions.

## Contribution and Collaboration
Siris welcomes contributions from the community to enhance component composition capabilities and overall project functionality. Developers are encouraged to contribute by creating new components, improving existing ones, suggesting enhancements, or addressing issues.
